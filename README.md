# BAN6420-Module-5-Milestone-2-Assignment-Principal-Component-Analysis: Anderson Cancer Center PCA Project



### Overview of the Assignment:
In this task, we will implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify essential variables for securing donor funding at the Anderson Cancer Center. The dataset we will use is the Breast Cancer dataset available in the scikit-learn library. Additionally, we will reduce the dataset into two principal components and optionally implement logistic regression for prediction as a bonus.



### Contents:
- **PCA Implementation**: Dimensionality reduction to 2 PCA components.
- **Logistic Regression (Bonus)**: Optional task for predicting cancer diagnoses (malignant or benign).

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:

3. Run the `pca_analysis.ipynb` script to see the PCA implementation and bonus logistic regression.

### Instructions:
- The `pca_analysis.ipynb` script implements PCA and visualizes the results with 2 principal components.
- The logistic regression is implemented to predict the cancer diagnosis.

### Files:
- **pca_analysis.ipynb**: Contains the Python code for PCA and Logistic Regression.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for running the project.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
